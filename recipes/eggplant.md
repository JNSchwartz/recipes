## Synonyms

- Sesame Eggplant Dip
- Roasted Eggplant Tahini Spread
- Vegan Smoky Aubergine Puree

## Ingredients

- **Eggplants**: 2 medium-sized (around 500g)
- **Tahini (Sesame Paste)**: 1 tablespoon (optional)
- **Garlic**: 2 cloves, minced (optional)
- **Lemon**: Juice of 1 (optional)
- **Salt**: to taste 
- **Liquid Smoke**: 2-3 drops (optional)
- **Lemon Essence**: 2-3 drops (optional)
- **Sesame Seeds and Fresh Parsley**: for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Place the eggplants on a baking sheet, punch many holes on them with a fork and roast them for an hour.
2. Once cool enough to handle, peel off the burnt skin and place the eggplant flesh in a bowl. You might drain some sauce if you want a stickier texture.
3. Add tahini, minced garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, liquid smoke, and lemon essence to the bowl. Use a fork or a food processor to mash/puree until smooth.
4. Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with sesame seeds and fresh parsley. Drizzle with a little olive oil before serving.

## Notes

- The liquid smoke gives the dip a smokier flavor if you don’t have a grill to roast the eggplants. It's optional but adds a lovely touch.
- You can serve this with sourdough bread, or fresh vegetable sticks.
- This dip is vegan-friendly!
